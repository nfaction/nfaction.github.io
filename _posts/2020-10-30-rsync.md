`rsync` is one of the most useful file transfer tools out there. I use it for just about any file/directory or backup I am wanting to do.

## Basics

Here's the basics:

``` bash
rsync <options> <from> <to>
```

## Copy a file from a remote server over SSH

``` bash
rsync -av --progress <local-file-or-directory> <username>@<server>:<destination-directory>
```
