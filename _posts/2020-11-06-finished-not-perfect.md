My entire life I have struggled with perfection. It's hard not to say, "Well, if I can't do it perfectly, why do it at all?". The thing is, how can you grow if you don't try? Getting something "done" or "finished" is more important than anything!

Failure is a very difficult concept. People often feel as though they are failures becaues they can't do anything right, or feel as though the fail before they even start! Fear not! We MUST fail to grow...

In my job, I fail literally all day, every day. Not every single line of code I write works. In fact, most of my code fails to run when I first execute it. However, the second and third time, it begins to not only work, but starts to implement the very thing I am trying to communicate... Before long, I have something that I made, and it works quite well! Don't let FAILURE control you. TRY!

I have to remind myself of this all the time... Get out of your own head and DO THINGS!
